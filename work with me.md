# This is how to best work with me

Based on the [Work With Me guide](http://workwithme.guide/)

## Values
- I support friendly, respectful work environments.
- If I spent time figuring something out, I try to improve the documentation for the next person.
- I care about building [ethical technology](https://mkdale.github.io/techoath/)
- I value meaningful work, integrity, growth, compassion, humility, and balance.

## Personality
I'm generally friendly, willing to help however I can, and enjoy collaborating.

I chose remote work because I do best with a self-controlled environment. I'm on the autism spectrum so I can come across as "strange" sometimes. I also have auditory processing issues, so I may ask for a repetition or recontextualization of information.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition
I prefer to receive negative feedback in writing first, with live discussion afterwards, if needed. I'm happy to recieve positive feedback or recognition in public.

## Work Patterns
_What hours do you usually work?_

I'm usually online around 8:30 am EST and clock off between 6:00-6:30 EST.

_When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups? How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?_

I start and end my day with deep work. I have those hours blocked off on my schedule. Meetings are possible during this time, but please ask first.

I have my most energy in the morning and have a little dip somewhere between 2:00 and 4:00. I usually have very little left in the tank at the end of the day. Similarly, Mondays are my most energetic and Friday I have little energy left.

## Communication Preferences
I respond quite promptly on Slack and only check email about twice a day. I only respond outside of working hours if the matter is urgent or the information I have will unblock someone still working (East Coast vs West Coast, for example).

If you're looking for whether it's okay to interupt me, check my calendar! If I'm in a meeting, obviously I can't respond. If it's during deep work hours, I can be contacted but may be a little slower to respond.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs
_When you don't feel safe in a conversation, how does this manifest itself in your actions or affects?_

I will get very quiet or may start responding defensively. I will also fidget a lot.

_What about when you're just not having an "on" or "good" day?_

I can get distracted, fidgeting will be worse, and my work may be sloppy with silly mistakes.

### How to help
Ask me if I'm having an off day and if I'd like to pair to resolve whatever it is I'm working on. 

## Me Being Me
_Do you have any habits that can be easily misinterpreted?_

I sometimes fidget or stim and that has nothing to do with my level of boredom. The same with getting sleepy in the middle of the afternoon.

I also have a habit of interrupting people in conversation or come across as waving my hand saying "Me, too! I know this thing!". I'm not trying to be rude, sometimes I just miss social cues and my enthusiasm for connecting with people on the same wavelength gets the better of me.

Additionally, I'll often be the first to respond when a question is asked in a group setting and my response may not be fully thought out. This is something I'm working on and is a result of some previous bad experiences where I had to prove myself and show I was contributing in a face-paced situation. This is particularly true in technical conversations.

## Pet Peeves
_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

I am uncomfortable in situations where I don't "know the lay of the land" or what's expected of me. I'm a planner.

## Career Goals & Future Interests
_What long term career goals do you have for yourself? What interests do you hope or plan for your
future self to obsess over._
